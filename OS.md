1) OS is an interface between user and computer hardware.
2) System call is a request made by the user program to OS in order to get any kind of service.
3) OS is also called as resource allocator.
4) The primary goal of OS is convenience(easy to use) and secondary goal is efficiency(stability).
5) Batch OS: If the job is completed completely then only another job will be scheduled onto the CPU. Increased CPU idleness and decreased throughput of the system.
6) Number of jobs completed per unit time is called throughput of the system.
7) Multiprogramming OS: If the job is leaving CPU to perform I/O operation then another job which is ready for execution will be scheduled onto the CPU. Increased CPU utilisation and throughput of the system. Eg- Windows, UNIX.
8) Multitasking OS: Extension of Multiprogramming OS. Jobs will be executed in time sharing mode. Eg- Windows, UNIX.
9) Multiprocessor Systems: Fault tolerant Systems (if one CPU fails other works). Eg- UNIX
10) Real time Systems: The systems which are strict deadly time bound are called as real time systems. 
     i) Soft Real time Systems: Banking Sector (Minor delay accepted)
     ii) Hard Real time Systems: Satellite System, Missile Systems, etc.
