1) Procedural programming: list of instructions in a single block. Suitable only for small programs.
2) Modular programming: procedural program is divided into functions and each function has a clear purpose. Limitation: Difficult to relate it with real world problems.
3) As modular programming needs more of our data to be global so that it can be accessed across the program but it has its own limitations.
4) It will create a mesh which is difficult to modify. The reason for such a mess is that the data and functions are separate.
5) So, we need to bind our data and functions that's what we do in object oriented approach by creating class.
6) The process of combining member variables and member functions is called encapsulation.
7) Class does not occupy any space but object does. Class is just a blueprint.
8) Object creation : house h1; where house is class name and member function is called as h1.area();
9) By default, access specifier is private. Private means member variables and member functions can be used within the class only.
10) Make member variables as private so that it can't be accessed outside class making it safe and make your member functions as public.
11) Whenever we create an object member varibales will get fresh or new space each time while member functions are shared between them.
12) class2 is child of class1 then class2 can use public and protected member variables only not private member variable.
13) If class2 is not child of class1 then class2 can only use public member variables like in main class we can't use protected or private member variables.
14) With this approach, we can hide our data. This is called data hiding.
15) Class is a user defined datatype, which holds its own data members and member funbctions. Class helps in code reusability.
16) Encapsulation is wraping up variables and methods in class. It helps in data hiding with the help of access specifiers.
