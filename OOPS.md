1) Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.
2) Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
3) Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
4) When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability and used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
5) When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.
6) Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing. In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
