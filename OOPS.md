1) Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.
2) Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
3) Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
4) When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability and used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
5) When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.
6) Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing. In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
7) Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
8) Advantages of OOPS: </br>
     i) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier </br>
     ii) OOPs provide data hiding </br>
     iii) OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively </br>
     iv) OOPs is faster and easier to execute </br>
     v) OOPs provides a clear structure for the programs </br>
     vi) OOPs helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug </br>
     vii) OOPs makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
9) The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
10) Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

12) Following two concepts explains everything why we need OOPs: </br>
     i) Duplicate code is a Bad </br>
     ii) Code will always be changed </br>
     --> So, above statement proves, OOPs provides code reusability which reduce the duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you can make changes everywhere
         which leads to performance </br>
     --> Code can be changed anytime or requirement of application can change anytime so when you want to make changes in your application, OOPs makes it easier </br>
